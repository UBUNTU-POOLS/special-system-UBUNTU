# Labour & Team Governance Framework

## 1. Philosophy
The internal operations of Ubuntu Pools are governed by the same philosophy of *Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu* that guides our pools. We treat our team as a high-trust circle.

## 2. Remote Work & OHS
As a distributed digital platform, we recognize the importance of mental health and digital ergonomics.
- **Digital Sovereignty**: Team members have clear "offline" boundaries to prevent burnout.
- **Ergonomic Allowance**: Support provided for verified workspace setups.

## 3. Technical Hard Gates for Staff
- **Zero-Custody Enforcement**: No platform employee, including developers, has the technical ability to trigger a fund movement.
- **Immutable Log Monitoring**: All admin actions are recorded in the hash-chained `audit_log`.

## 4. Conflict of Interest
Staff members may participate in Ubuntu Pools but must disclose all pool memberships to the Compliance Officer to prevent "Wash Vouching" or trust score manipulation.
