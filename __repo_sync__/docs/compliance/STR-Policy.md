# Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) Policy

## Framework
Ubuntu Pools identifies and flags suspicious activity based on "Intent Patterns" since no real value movement occurs within the Model A platform.

## Red Flag Indicators
1. **Unusual Volume**: Simulated contributions significantly exceeding community averages for a specific pool type.
2. **Velocity Spikes**: Rapid succession of intent records from a single account in a short duration.
3. **Structured Intent**: Multiple small contributions intended to bypass internal monitoring thresholds.

## Reporting Procedure
- **Level 1**: Automated flagging in the Admin Console.
- **Level 2**: Review by the Platform Compliance Officer.
- **Level 3**: Filing of an STR with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) should real value movement be detected or attempted via unauthorized channels.
