# Know Your Customer (KYC) & Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Policy

## Objective
To ensure that all participants in Ubuntu Pools are legitimate and do not pose a risk to the community's financial integrity.

## Verification Tiers

### Tier 1: Basic (Community Intro)
- Email verification
- Phone number binding (ShapID)

### Tier 2: FICA Verified (Full Participation)
- National ID / Passport capture
- Biometric liveness check
- Proof of Address (where required by local stokvel bylaws)

## Sanction Screening
All verified users are cross-referenced against:
- OFAC Sanctions List
- UN Security Council Consolidated List
- Local (South African) FIC high-risk watchlists

## Ongoing Monitoring
Reputation (Ubuntu Score) serves as a dynamic due diligence tool. Sudden drops in score or suspicious activity patterns trigger an immediate re-verification requirement.
