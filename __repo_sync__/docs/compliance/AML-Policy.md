# Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy

## Objective
To prevent the use of Ubuntu Pools for money laundering or terrorist financing in accordance with the South African FIC Act.

## Phase 1 Limitations
During Model A development, Ubuntu Pools does not facilitate the exchange of currency. All activity is a simulation of "Intent".

## KYC/CDD Requirements
All members must undergo:
1. Proof of Identity (SA National ID / Passport)
2. Biometric Liveness Verification
3. Sanction List Screening (OFAC/UN)

## Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR)
While no real funds move, suspicious "intent patterns" (e.g., unusually large simulated contributions from unverified sources) will be logged and flagged for administrative review.
