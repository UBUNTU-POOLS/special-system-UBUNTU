# Digital Evidence Waiver & Authoritative Record Clause

## 1. Primacy of the Event Store
All participants in Ubuntu Pools acknowledge and agree that the `event_log` and `audit_log` stored on the Platform constitute the primary and authoritative record of all actions, contributions, and governance votes.

## 2. Waiver of Informal Evidence
In the event of a dispute, parties explicitly waive the right to rely on informal communications, including but not limited to:
- WhatsApp or SMS messages.
- Email correspondence.
- Verbal agreements or recorded voice notes.
Unless such communications have been explicitly verified and logged as a hash-chained event within the Platform architecture.

## 3. Cryptographic Admissibility
The Platform employs SHA-256 hash chaining to ensure the integrity of its records. In accordance with the South African **Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA)**, these cryptographically secured logs shall be treated as "original" and "authentic" documents for all legal purposes.

## 4. Verification Rights
Any party to an Accord, or a lawfully appointed arbitrator, has the right to request a verified **Audit Pack** export. This pack contains the full hash-chain proof necessary to demonstrate that the records have not been altered since their inception.
